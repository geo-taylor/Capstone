            Amapiano, from my own perspective is a fascinating rootsy genre from South Africa. The entrancing music features long buildups and crescendos, with palette that can span from high energy to liquid and chill in the same song.  The beat and rhythms feature traditional African percussion, focusing both on highly rhythmic repetition layered with unique syncopation, keeping the listener engaged.
